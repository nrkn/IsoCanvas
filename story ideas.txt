Orb of Worlds
  * Dungeon crawler
  * Quick summary is that it's an excuse to genre-mash, ie scifi vs fantasy vs
    western etc.
  * Instead of one large overland map that allows you to enter smaller areas 
    re. Diablo, it is composed of multiple small worlds (ahem, like doom levels)
  * The orb is an artifact that allows the player to dimension shift
  * There are creatures that live between the worlds that lock on to the orb,
    you have to keep moving or they find and attack you. In the early game they
    are too powerful to overcome. There are two ways that they can lock on to
    you, if you shift too often (so has a cooldown timer) or if you stay in one
    world for too long - sense of urgency
  * Each world is procedurally generated along the lines of a theme - initially
    probably just easy stuff ie a sci-fi (doom) theme and a medieval theme. 
    Theme is just texture/map style, enemy types, weapon types, artifacts etc.
    See POSSIBLE THEMES below
  * Each world has a minor orb to collect - possibly the goal is to collect a 
    certain number. Orbs take forms relevant to theme, ie in Doom it might be 
    the blue soulsphere, in a fantasy setting it might be a circular tavern sign
    etc. 
  * Limbo level, a sort of central hub  
  * How to multiplayer? Having many small worlds should make easy to scale though
